Some questions about the code:

	- Problems to implement the virtual servers config when same host:port
		1. Need to change file etc/hosts but we have no permission (find alternatives)
		2. In the actual findClientServerConfig we try to match the host of the request with the server_name, but as we can't change the etc/hosts file we only can acces de 127.0.0.1 host writing localhost in the navigater, so we have always the same server_name for that IP.
