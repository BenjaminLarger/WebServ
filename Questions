Some questions about the code:

	-	I dont understand the functionality os the buffer map that is used in the serverListeningLoop (WebservUtils.cpp),
		couse then you declare another buffer and you just use this second one.
=> I review the code, it just seemed to be useless lines. I have edited in the new version. Thanks for the notice
